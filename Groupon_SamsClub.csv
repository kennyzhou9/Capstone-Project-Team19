David,"Sucked!!! Never got an email from Sam's Club giving me my membership number. Called local Sam's Club to get,but they wouldn't give me any information over the phone. Was told to come in. Two managers wouldn't help me. I phoned an 888# given to me. Got the Philippines. Without giving them my personal information I obtained my membership # apparently thru caller id,so go figure!!!!",2,0,0,0,03/18/2021,03/28/2021 09:22:00

Steve,Sam's Club did not honor free pizza promo. I went to Sam's club several times and explained that I I have not received the promo that was supposed to be e-mailed or loaded into my account. They asked me to call Groupon and a Grooupon rep says that they are not the ones responsible for the promo and I should go back to Sam's Club. Problem not resolved.

Louis,"The problem was not the buy it is Sam’s. It is just dirty inside. Where food is it should be fairly clean. It is not, the packages are damaged, crushed, and laying in aisles. I doubt it would take more than 2 hours to just clean, sweep and straighten up. Unfortunately another competitor is across the road,, a large clean competitor. My opinion.

Turquoise,So today I went into Sam’s Club for the first time. It was awesome I am in a family of 6 and got some really great deals. I honestly believe it’s so worth the buy. I got my free pizza my variety cheesecake. I didn’t get my free rolls but I bought them anyway and 3.98 and my kids loved them and wanted more. The price for the membership was great and the free perks was great. I definitely love my Sam’s Membership m!,5,0,0,0,01/06/2021,03/28/2021 09:27:17

Second when you redeem voucher if you don't immediately write down or screen save info. It's gone forever. Third groupon customer service doesn't respond to emails. Not even 2 weeks later. Have to cancel transaction with card provider. Frustrating,2,0,0,1,06/26/2020,03/28/2021 09:47:05

Kathleen,"Poor customer service, especially if you bought thru Groupon because that throws the Sams Club staff into a tizzy. You might find a couple of deals, but I find most of their prices comparable to retail stores.. except, at Sam's you have to buy in bulk. Unless you are a large family or a business, it's probably not going to be worth it to you. I like their chickens and blueberries, but that's not enough incentive, for me, to purchase a membership again.",4,0,0,0,02/10/2020,03/28/2021 10:01:02

Erin,I bought a membership to Sam’s club specifically for their prices on bulk meat. They are definitely the cheapest I have found.

Although Costco's checkout is faster Sam's has self checkout which in most cases is much faster if you have 10 or less items.,1,0,0,0,06/27/2018,03/28/2021 10:58:03

Courtney,Sams club did not know how to redeem the groupon and had me redeem it without all the information needed so it did not work. They then advised me I would have to call Groupon and request my new member number since they told me wrong.

Called Groupon and the customer service was horrible she was no help then asked for a refund and was told had to wait until I got an email in 72 hours if they decide whether they goin to do it or not.

Lynn,"Great place for bulk shopping, and finding deals you didn't even know you needed. They have been a huge help for my upcoming wedding and needing to buy in vast quantities. Only downside is the Tucker Sams Club, which is my local. They are horrifically overcrowded on Sundays and usually have 2 cashiers open, so plan to stand in line for like 30mins. Also plan to deal with extremely rude staff. I've been to a few other SAMs in Atlanta, and this was THE worst.",5,0,0,1,05/12/2016,03/28/2021 11:43:29

Satonya,I was skeptical on purchasing a wholesale club membership. I didn't think the unit cost savings was significant enough to make it worth the annual fee. I thought you were just buying in bulk and there was no real savings. The Groupon deal made it easy to give it a try. I love the prices at Sam's and I have saved a lot compared to grocery store prices. I will definitely renew my membership.,4,0,0,0,05/12/2016,03/28/2021 11:43:33
