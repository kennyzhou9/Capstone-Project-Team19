Debbie,Really like the items at BJ's. I also have a Costco membership. They both have very different offerings from one another. I like BJs deli counter and bakery. The cons when comparing them to Costco- not as clean and bright. The BJs employees don't seem to have the enthusiasm that the Costco employees do. BJs is more like a warehouse atmosphere. I think the electronics and home goods are much more upscale at Costco.,5,0,1,0,02/25/2016,04/07/2021 13:31:28

Noemi,"I love BJ's Wholesale club. The employees are super friendly, it's very clean, they always have everything I need, and most of all you don't have to overbuy so much of the product and the prices are great and within the budget. I can actually see where I spendy money and not say I spent $100 dollars and only got 2 bags! I really love BJ's and I will for sure renew.",5,0,1,0,11/08/2013,04/07/2021 13:43:00
