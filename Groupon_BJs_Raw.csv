I’ve always appreciated BJ’s and shopped at a BJ’s since I lived in New York. The BJ’s in Waterford CT is fine but can you stop the coupons and just mark it down. COSTO JUST MOVED In and I do t have to deal with COUPONS.

I bought it for my daughter and her fiancé for Christmas so I didn’t catch it had an early expiration date. My daughter was talking about them getting one so I ended up telling her and showing her the Groupon. It ended THAT DAY. LITERALLY IN ONE HOUR. We ran to BJs and an account was opened for her in seconds

Busy day at the Victor location and the customer service representative acted inconvenienced to issue membership card based on it being Groupon. She asked me several times if I actually purchased the Groupon and went through all the steps. I had my voucher up showing it was complete. The membership is a great deal. Just feel bad for the underpaid/overworked employees. I do feel bad it was busy.

Great! $25 for an entire year, so simple to purchase on Groupon, and then even simpler to actually get your membership cards when you arrive at store. I walked in with my husband, IDs in hand, walked up to the membership services bit, showed her my Groupon voucher on the app. She knew what she was doing, took our IDs and printed us out a card each. Done in under 3mins! Lovely customer service too.

The nearest Costco is 1hr away so Bj’s it is. They have a few good deals on certain things but Walmart and ALDI still offer a better deal on many things so I’m glad I got the membership via discount because I can’t say it’s a great deal. Considering the limited shopping options of my geographic area though, it’s a good option to have. I will say their staff can’t operate registers & they’re rude!!

Not as great as Costco and it’s third place behind Sam’s. Spice portions are much smaller, small selection or portions I would purchase at Costco or Sam’s. I would go to BJ’s for gas but not much else. I still have to compare the price of gasoline as compared to Costco in Columbia.

I have visited BJs in other states but not as a member. I live single and solo so I really doesn't pay for me to buy in bulk; however, for an introductory membership, I decided to give it a go. Electronics, clothing, the bakery peaked my interest. However someone needs to focus on fixing the elevators (shopping is in the basement, lower level).

I like BJS and have been a customer for many years. Recently Over the past couple of years the long lines at checkout and customer service have made shopping there unpleasant. I like the products and the prices but the long lines don’t seem to be worth the hassle. I hope the club can find a way to make shopping there a better experience.

When I bought this I thought the expiration date was the redeem voucher by date. I didn’t realize that the membership activated right then. This isn’t a deal for me because now I have less than a week to see if the gas and cheap prices are worth it! I’m not buying a membership for $55 and I guess I won’t be back 🤷🏽‍♀️

Why not just make them all instant coupons and do away with all the ridiculous coupon clipping. Oh and then there are the lines.

Compared to Costco, BJs seemed small & not as clean. Selection & pricing is still good. I like that they take all major credit cards, Apple Pay & Android Pay. They have self checkout too. Good for small orders. The bad: Too many price tags were missing, some employees seemed annoyed & a little careless + no rotisserie chicken during my visit. Membership is worth $25 but I doubt I’d renew for $55.

I had no issue signing up for membership at the store. I never received the BJ bucks. The store said they could not help. Called BJ's customer service and they said they could not help. Went live chat with a Groupon rep and was told because I didn't keep the confirmation email that I was not going to be able to be helped even though Groupon was given my BJ's membership number.

There is always a discrepancy with BJ's over when your year's membership starts with a Groupon--it's supposed to start when you redeem it, but they always say it starts when you actually purchase it, which is not correct. Then it takes a couple months to contact corporate, find someone who knows something, and get it straightened out. This has happened to us...

The gas prices can fluctuate from a great deal to not a deal at all. The bakery is my favorite area. Excellent baked goods at a good price.

I like the store for the prices in items and the fact that they have a deli. The deli meat in itself is very affordable and good tasting. My only complaint is they need to be more staffed. Checkout lines are usually very long. As well as deli lines. I’ve waited over 30 mins before. Express lines are available but people with more than the amount utilize and not fair for guests with express items.

Read the fine print for this Groupon. You have to wait 48 hours to use it. For this year a $25 membership is worth it for me, because the BJ's in DE sell gas and propane. I have been a Costco member for years, and after doing comparison shopping, I still prefer Costco. Thus far, Costco offers better products and prices. Additionally, Costco has more organic and gluten free products.

Warehouse is small and conventional yet they carry most items other warehouses carry just on a smaller scale. Gas station is a plus and like other warehouses they sample some of the food they sell. The $25.00 Groupon that I paid for membership is appropriate pricing for membership at this warehouse...all the time.

Staff were nice, the pricing itself is not very impressive. Some of their prices were more expensive than comparable or identical items in a regular grocery store. And as far as being able to buy things in bulk, the brand selection was almost non-existent, choices were quite limited.

A suggestion: I like the coupon books but there is no way I can remember all the different offers. It would help if there was some type of small sign, sticker or tag next to each price on the shelf letting the shoppers know a coupon is available. It would also be great if each coupon could be used for multiple purchases instead if getting more coupons.

I love some of the workers of not most, I do not like the management their AT ALL what so ever. This past week I went it's was horrible. I guess they have a lot of bad days at BJs(manager wise). My overall view I love it, they have to bring their prices down back to normal.. they got a little high over the months.

Redeeming the Groupon voucher was very easy and the coupon booklet we received was great. Despite visiting on a Saturday afternoon, our local store was not too busy, so we could shop easily and were impressed by the range of products and prices available. We used several coupons and the gift card on our first visit, saving at least $35. I would therefore highly recommend this Groupon deal.

This Groupon states that a $55 coupon book is included, but I did not receive it. The customer service at the membership desk was poor. The representative did not speak to me the whole time I was there. He just handed me my card when he was done. When I said thank you he didn't respond. I gave it a three because the selection and prices in the store are good.

We have stopped using these mega stores because of their lack of organic selection. It was such a wonderful surprise to see how many different options BJ's has now. (I wish they would bring back their organic spices in glass jars.)

The Groupon deal was good! One year membership plus $25 gift card. I bought the deal in November and went to claim it on feb 10. Everything was fine till I went to check out with my $35 card. That worked well also BUT the expire membership date was middle November of this year, not Feb 10 2018. I went back to customer service (wait in line again) and lady said the coupon starts when you bought Groupon. Called Groupon waiting for results. Groupon.

They offered a card that would give you a 2% return on your purchases. I gas my car and purchase groceries there weekly, so I was expecting a return of some value. After a year I called and was then informed that all purchases were not eligible for that 2% return. I found that to be misleading from what I was initially told. Thus, will not be renewing under the 2% program.

Completing my purchase of Groupon's $40 BJs offer at the Brier Creek store was simple, fast and the customer service was superlative. Thank you Bonnie! Add to that the $25 Gift Card (net 33% off purchases) and 5¢ off gas, I would say this was a good Groupon purchase!

I've been a long time customer of another wholesale club. I saw the Groupon for BJ's and decided to give them a try. I'm so happy I did! It is much less crowded, quieter and the isles are clearly marked. The staff is very helpful and happy. The prices are comparable to the other wholesale clubs and the variety of goods sold are just as good as the others.

They were wonderful at the Oneonta, NY location. A little slow at first because the gentleman who was helping us had never processed a groupon. After he figured out with assistance from another person who was experienced it went really quickly. The second one was done in less than three minutes. Went shopping and I have to say this was totally worth doing.

When I went in to redeem my Groupon, they told me that they were not honoring it because that particular store was not part of the offer. When I showed the manager my groupon that had a map and address to his store, he said he would honor it. However I'm still waiting for my $25 gift card that he said would come directly from groupon within 4-6 weeks. That's not what the groupon said.

I like BJ's but they could definitely offer more vegetarian & especially vegan selections. They have a couple of brands but of the 3 I saw... there were only a couple of flavors. A few of the brands they sell do offer a vegan choice but BJ's apparently doesn't carry them... e.g. Mrs. T's Perogies has a vegan potato & onion version but they only carry the potato & cheddar; & Gardein has many more than 3 choices.

I bought the membership under the assumption that BJ's was very similar to Costco. Not even close! Costco has so much more, including a much larger selection of organic/healthy products. I only went to BJ's once and I walked out of the place not even buying anything. I was so disappointed. A majority of the consumable goods in that place is processed junk. If you want a better selection and better prices, go to Costco.

You can use a manufacturers coupon and a BJ's coupon at the same time and get better savings. I purchased 30 rolls Charmin big roll toilet paper at BJ's for $28.99.. There was a BJ's $3 off coupon in my membership book and then I had a $2.00 coupon out of the Sunday paper and that brought the price down more.. So I spent $25.46 after tax for 30 big rolls.. For a family of 4 that is a great buy.. I will not have to worry about paper for atleast a month or two!

Really like the items at BJ's. I also have a Costco membership. They both have very different offerings from one another. I like BJs deli counter and bakery. The cons when comparing them to Costco- not as clean and bright. The BJs employees don't seem to have the enthusiasm that the Costco employees do. BJs is more like a warehouse atmosphere. I think the electronics and home goods are much more upscale at Costco.

I got the BJ's Groupon offer for $25.00 for one year- then searched for a promo coupon to get an additional $5.00 off. Highly recommended! Easy payment with PayPal. Prices are great. Lots of variety. If the bulk is too much for you, bring a friend and split it! They take manufacturer's coupons as well as offer their own in-store coupons.

It's good that it was only $25 for my 1 year membership, I didn't really care for their selection of electronics. No real discount, I would have been upset had a spent $50 on a membership. Thanks Groupon.

You have to get a pic taken for your ID card while you are there and so does your other person (if you are having someone use the second card). It's easier to have the other person with you so you don't have to bring them to the courtesy desk next time to add them. Just an FYI for your convenience.

BJ's packages their grocery items in 2 or 3 packs of smaller, more usable bags/jars/cans. This is what attracted us to them 5 years ago vs. Sam's Club where we had previously been a member. For example, instead of having to buy a gallon of hot sauce, BJ's has 2 smaller bottles bundled together.

I am a Costco member for almost three years. This year I got a trial membership to BJ's and went there. I think that the prices are on par with the Costco, but in BJs you can buy stuff in smaller quantities. I probably still like Costco better because of the assortment (or I just got used to certain things), but getting the BJ's membership for a year for $10 is a great deal in my opinion.

The customer service lines are notoriously long and slow. After waiting on the line to activate my Groupon today, I was told that the ID card machine was broken, so today I'd be given a temporary shopping pass, and next time I wanted to go to a BJ's I'd have to wait on the long, slow line again to have my photo taken for a BJ's card. Really?

if you give this as a gift, you will have to go to BJ's first to activate the membership. They ask you for recipient's name and address. Then, recipient can go to any BJ's and receive their membership card. A little bit inconvenient, but a great deal. They should explain the process a little better in the details.

Even though you pay membership fees, you will find some products same/more priced as elsewhere. Be careful while doing shopping at BJs. They have some items at wholesale rate though but you will need to know other store prices to be sure.

The groupon was the only thing that made the club worth it. I belong to Sam's and Costco, and this club just doesn't compete in their world, at least not in Richmond, VA. Their membership cost as much as the others, but don't join unless it's the only club available, or you have a super deal. They do carry items the other clubs don't, so I will shop there on occasion, but the store is basically the bottom line of discount clubs.

Does not compare to the staff, cleanliness, products that are offered by Costco where I am also a member. I only use BJ's because it is closer to my home than Costco. I only buy things like bread, water, butter, cheese & some frozen brand name items. It was a good deal for the convenience of getting these items in a pinch. Maybe other locations are better, but I am usually desperate in order to make a trip there.

Still doing my research, but Costco seems cheaper on some items. Of course BJ's does carry some items not at Costco, but nothing that ""wow'ed"" me. The staff are super friendly. In the end, and what it comes down to, I won't renew my membership simply because I'd rather not give my money to Wal-Mart. I don't shop at Wal-Mart now (and will go out of my way if possible) due to, among other thing, their labor practices.

I went this past weekend and was given the gift card and a temporary card (a piece of paper for one use only). They said their printer was down. Than they took it upon themselves to press the button on my phone to show the groupon redeemed. I will have to go back to get my membership card. I just hope they do not give me a hard time about it.

I purchased a 1 yr membership 12/13 that had to be activated by 3/31/14. I activated it 3/13/14 and my recept says it expires 12/14. The 1 yr started when I purchased the Groupon, not when I activated my membership. Why give 3 months to activate and then penalize for it? My membership should expire next March (1 yr), not this December (9 months).

The service desk associate, Frank, was awesome. He could not have been friendlier and more helpful. The cashiers could use a little bit of training in the friendliness dept though. It was our first time at this place and we were a little lost on the ""typical checkout procedures."" The cashier didn't even say hello to us, let alone assist with making this easier in any manner.

I love bjs! Bjs came into town and I already had a sams club membership. But after trying the bjs 60 day trial, I decided I needed to join! So much better than sams club! Super helpful and friendly staff. I've never had a bad experience there and I love that they have organic for options!

I had been a member before and really wasn't impressed. It looks like they have really improved. More items that I am looking for competitive prices. Gas seems to be a hot or miss as for as being the best price but it's nice to have an option. Looking forward to seeing how this year goes.

Been meaning to get a membership to BJs for awhile. They offer bulk packs of merchandise, grocery & deli items, and most club locations have tires and basic automobile needs. Pricing is usually worth it over buying single items in the store, assuming you have a place to keep the extra until you need it.

BJs is the best! But my Wife and I couldn't afford the $50 membership. When I saw the Groupon for only $35 and then you get another $25 gift card on top of that! I had to take the deal. Thanks BJs and Groupon for this offer.

As a Costco member I couldn't justify another warehouse club membership. But the is a BJs right by my office so when I saw the Groupon I had to get it. I was very impressed with what BJs has to offer. I was very excited to see they sell Pampers which Costco doesn't and that is the only brand my son wears.

You pay $35 for a year membership that normally costs $50 plus you get a $25 gift card so you basically only pay $10! This is a really great deal! And BJ's is a great, you can pay with anyform that you like, you can do self checkout and you can use coupons.

I can actually see where I spendy money and not say I spent $100 dollars and only got 2 bags! I really love BJ's and I will for sure renew.

BJ's provides a more pleasant shopping experience than other clubs or large stores. I don't go for the prices, actually, since clubs (lately) are about as expensive as supermarkets and other retailers. Sometimes, however, you find things at Bj's that you won't find elsewhere.

The customer service sucked at the first store and on the phone. I then went to the location in Pembroke Pines and they were great. I was helped in less than 10 minutes by Heather with no problem. It shouldn't take me driving almost an hour away to get proper assistance.
