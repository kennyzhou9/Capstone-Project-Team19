Far too many employees who knew far too little about the store, (headset in, employee standing there while in a very enjoyable personal call). In general there seems to be little concern about making sure the people getting paid are doing what they're paid for, but that's not my business I got my items and got out. The store offers a great selection of everything I'll keep going there for that.

This time it said it couldn’t process my credit card. The girl came over and said the chip reader was “finicky” and you have to hold the card up to the screen for it to be read.

In store, the basic membership costs $55. Here, it's only $40. But you can find it on Facebook for $25. I shopped there yesterday, for the first time. Their selection was limited and higher than Sam's Club.

Horrible experience using the Groupon at the Newnan, GA location. Jessica scanned the barcode on voucher and she marked it as redeemed. She signed us up and then asked me to pay. I responded you just marked the Groupon as redeemed and that I paid on Groupon. She asked me to dispute it with Groupon and pay again. She made a comment “if I paid on Groupon”. I showed the manager the email from Groupon

I didn't know this membership will be count when you bought it from day one. So, we just activated my membership 1 week ago but BJ's only gave me 2 month membership instead1 year BJ's inner circle membership because they told me my voucher already activated on April 2020. I lost my time if I didn't activate immediately. So don't buy it if you plan not activate you voucher immediately.

I just went to redeem my membership card and it was a long line. Some customers started bringing their items to the Member Service line. The regular single line was soo long, it stretched all the way to the fruit section, near the back of the store🙄. I left the store after just picking up my new membership card. Will try again another day.

BJs hasn't let me down; usually everything is in stock and they have a nice array of merchandise. BJs online is also a very valuable resource for ordering pantry items and other dry goods. My BJs Groupon price was very nominal; great for a tight budget.

Very easy. Just make sure to put the proper name of the membership when you sign up, their computers will have that same. The voucher, though, will have the Groupon account name.

No problems with activating my Groupon or using the plethora of coupons in my coupon book. The deals are great too—as much as $4 off some items.

Love Bj's and their coupons and low priced gas. All around savings. Tried another wholesale club and was very disappointed. Bj's has the largest varieties, best coupons, and all around savings. Our family will drive to extra miles to go to Bj's instead of going to the closer wholesale - the coupons along make it worth the drive!

Great value, big exciting store with lots to offer & great customer service. Keep in mind that every time you use a Groupon when you renew your membership, you have to start a whole new account with BJ's every time. That's the one thing I don't like when using Groupon deal. But it's totally worth the bargain for cost of membership!

The $20 Groupon BJ’s Membership is not really the same as the regular $55 BJ’s membership. Groupon memberships are only one person, not 2 in the same family. Also Groupon members do not earn a rebate, that regular members earn.

Total rip off. If you buy this apparently you get one membership card. I use to get two. One for me and one for my wife. For $15 more you get two membership cards. You get more convenience buying the full $55 membership.

I like BJS and have been a customer for many years. Recently Over the past couple of years the long lines at checkout and customer service have made shopping there unpleasant. I like the products and the prices but the long lines don’t seem to be worth the hassle. I hope the club can find a way to make shopping there a better experience.

When I bought this I thought the expiration date was the redeem voucher by date. I didn’t realize that the membership activated right then. This isn’t a deal for me because now I have less than a week to see if the gas and cheap prices are worth it! I’m not buying a membership for $55 and I guess I won’t be back 🤷🏽‍♀️

Compared to Costco, BJs seemed small & not as clean. Selection & pricing is still good. I like that they take all major credit cards, Apple Pay & Android Pay. They have self checkout too. Good for small orders. The bad: Too many price tags were missing, some employees seemed annoyed & a little careless + no rotisserie chicken during my visit. Membership is worth $25 but I doubt I’d renew for $55.

As far as BJ's itself: I think it's quite wonderful!

I bought the voucher the same day I was going to BJ’s— it didn’t show up on the Groupon site. I was told by customer service to shop and then she’d ring me out and maybe by then it would show up. Shopping done— voucher still didn’t appear. My old BJ’s account kept showing up, not the one from Groupon.

Please check with Groupon to see what the real issue with this voucher is. I along with other customers were at BJ’s attempting to use the Groupon and BJS could not find our name with the purchase. I was there over 30mins and they could not find my voucher. Eventually they just manually decided to create an account for me since I showed them I actually bought the voucher.

I l really like BJ's and this offer allowed me to try it out and compare to the other wholesale stores in my area (Sam's and Costco) BJ's is closer than Costco however, it does not have as big of a selection as Costco and for that reason I probably will not renew and go back to Costco...Worth every penny though I would stay if I could pay the price of the deal for renewal otherwise its a 1 year opt out for me

There is always a discrepancy with BJ's over when your year's membership starts with a Groupon--it's supposed to start when you redeem it, but they always say it starts when you actually purchase it, which is not correct. Then it takes a couple months to contact corporate, find someone who knows something, and get it straightened out. This has happened to us...

Generally I like it. However, you need to know your prices. Not everything is a good deal. We have also found that not all stores are the same. We prefer some stores over others. The gas prices can fluctuate from a great deal to not a deal at all. The bakery is my favorite area. Excellent baked goods at a good price. Coupons are a huge plus over Sam’s Club which does not take coupons. Gifcards are also a good deal, always at a discount.

Overall it's a good BJ's. Even when they do not have stock they will get it from the rafters. And management seems good too. The issues I have is that they desperately need more front desk. And assistance to help with self checkout because they are never paying attention. Often I have abandoned my checkout to go to another register because of this. They definitely have issues with those registers.

Read the fine print for this Groupon. You have to wait 48 hours to use it. For this year a $25 membership is worth it for me, because the BJ's in DE sell gas and propane. I have been a Costco member for years, and after doing comparison shopping, I still prefer Costco. Thus far, Costco offers better products and prices.

I have had no success with this groupon. By the time I went in they were saying it was expired. This is supposed to last a year. The person on the phone prior to my going in did not give any indication of time. I dont understand how groupon expects me to pay $50 for absolutely NOTHING! and I certainly never received the bonus $20. Very unhappy customer. I have had a Bj's card twice before.

Prices aren't as low as they are at Costco and you need coupons to get the special deals. As in, paper coupons that need to be clipped out of their flier. Seems like an attempt to get out of the special prices (oh you don't have your coupon? Sorry, can't give you the deal then).

A suggestion: I like the coupon books but there is no way I can remember all the different offers. It would help if there was some type of small sign, sticker or tag next to each price on the shelf letting the shoppers know a coupon is available. It would also be great if each coupon could be used for multiple purchases instead if getting more coupons.

I thought I would get information re the service I bought. When I didn't hear from BJ's or had no number to call re getting the ""deal"" a card or something, I went in. It took about an hour. The clerk asked for my cell phone, my passwords, and finally found the ""number"" and did give me a card and coupons.

The two ladies who worked in the Customer Service Department were very pleasant and knowledgeable in assisting me. The store is in a very nice location in Capitol Heights, MD and the gas prices are usually cheaper. Not to mention the deal was a good deal.

Very easy to get the membership set up. Absolutely great variety of products and competitive pricing. I am planning frequent trips to BJ's from now on. Without the offer from Groupon I kept on delaying paying for a membership for a store that is 1 hour away from me but I enjoyed the overall experience. Thanks!

Their credit card bank Comenity is a very rude and nasty bank. I was approved and in less then 3-weeks I was informed that my account was closed. They closed my account because there was a group of many inquires put there by car dealership when I purchased a new car. therefore I will not shop or be a member of BJ'S again.

Redeeming the Groupon voucher was very easy and the coupon booklet we received was great. Despite visiting on a Saturday afternoon, our local store was not too busy, so we could shop easily and were impressed by the range of products and prices available. We used several coupons and the gift card on our first visit, saving at least $35. I would therefore highly recommend this Groupon deal.

What a deal! It will pay for itself when you consider the benefits of the offer...$20 BJ's gift card, coupons ($5 and $10) that I will actually use AND I get a card for anyone in my family for free (some exclusions on this one.). If you are ready to renew, this OS the way to go!

I enjoy shopping at BJ's because they accept coupons and they have such a wide variety of items, it's only a one-stop-shopping. It was really great to have a Groupon for BJ's membership. It would be great if it came up again. Thank you.

They offered a card that would give you a 2% return on your purchases. I gas my car and purchase groceries there weekly, so I was expecting a return of some value. After a year I called and was then informed that all purchases were not eligible for that 2% return. I found that to be misleading from what I was initially told.

I have hard time opening the card. The line was enormously long. Their camera did not work and I did not received a plastic card. People who work in the store just walk around and talk each other. They do not care about customer. On the Customer Service desk were two middle age ladies who are the slowest Customer Services I have ever seen.

We join BJs because they carry a few items that Costco does not. However, Costco carries more items we use than BJs so we prefer Costco. Here's another reason why: Costco's checkout lines are much faster than BJs and often have a helper at the end. Even though BJs has an express line it usually is terribly slow. Worst of all are the way BJs handles coupons....

The front desk woman was very nice and funny. Of course, because I had the $25 gift card, I felt like a baller and spent way too much. I recommend this membership to anyone. We have a small family but we work a lot and this eliminates frequent trips to the store. I also loathe clipping coupons, so again, saves us time and money. Did I mention free samples of yummy treats?

They were wonderful at the Oneonta, NY location. A little slow at first because the gentleman who was helping us had never processed a groupon. After he figured out with assistance from another person who was experienced it went really quickly. The second one was done in less than three minutes.

Typical big box store with a large selection of goods. Took them a while to get the membership card and gift certificate issued - the person that started the process had to get help with the groupon coupon order. They did give us an extra 3 months on the membership for the extra waiting time.

I like BJ's but they could definitely offer more vegetarian & especially vegan selections. They have a couple of brands but of the 3 I saw... there were only a couple of flavors. A few of the brands they sell do offer a vegan choice but BJ's apparently doesn't carry them... e.g. Mrs. T's Perogies has a vegan potato & onion version but they only carry the potato & cheddar; & Gardein has many more than 3 choices.

I bought the membership under the assumption that BJ's was very similar to Costco. Not even close! Costco has so much more, including a much larger selection of organic/healthy products. I only went to BJ's once and I walked out of the place not even buying anything. I was so disappointed. A majority of the consumable goods in that place is processed junk. If you want a better selection and better prices, go to Costco.

You can use a manufacturers coupon and a BJ's coupon at the same time and get better savings. I purchased 30 rolls Charmin big roll toilet paper at BJ's for $28.99.. There was a BJ's $3 off coupon in my membership book and then I had a $2.00 coupon out of the Sunday paper and that brought the price down more.. So I spent $25.46 after tax for 30 big rolls.. For a family of 4 that is a great buy.. I will not have to worry about paper for atleast a month or two!

If there are just a few products you use on a regular basic the basic membership is well worth it. I got it because I have dogs and it works out good for saving on there food. Espessially since BJ's will take coupons as well.

Really like the items at BJ's. I also have a Costco membership. They both have very different offerings from one another. I like BJs deli counter and bakery. The cons when comparing them to Costco- not as clean and bright. The BJs employees don't seem to have the enthusiasm that the Costco employees do. BJs is more like a warehouse atmosphere.

I got the BJ's Groupon offer for $25.00 for one year- then searched for a promo coupon to get an additional $5.00 off. Highly recommended! Easy payment with PayPal. Prices are great. Lots of variety. If the bulk is too much for you, bring a friend and split it! They take manufacturer's coupons as well as offer their own in-store coupons. Daily samples introduce you to products that you never thought to try! Thanks!!

I am a Costco member for almost three years. This year I got a trial membership to BJ's and went there. I think that the prices are on par with the Costco, but in BJs you can buy stuff in smaller quantities. I probably still like Costco better because of the assortment (or I just got used to certain things), but getting the BJ's membership for a year for $10 is a great deal in my opinion.

This is a warehouse store. I usually shop at their major competitor in our area. BJ's sells smaller sizes of packaged food instead of the 5 - 10 pound cans/boxes that their competitor sells. My small family will realistically finish the food before it goes bad. Also they have a fresh deli section. Aisles are wide and store is very nicely stocked.

the customer service personnel was in need of some serious training. when I informed her of an issue with the groupon she just grunted and walked away. I had no idea what was going on. the issue is when you buy one as a gift you cannot enter the receiver's name. apparently this caused the customer service agent a frustrating situation.

The customer service lines are notoriously long and slow. After waiting on the line to activate my Groupon today, I was told that the ID card machine was broken, so today I'd be given a temporary shopping pass, and next time I wanted to go to a BJ's I'd have to wait on the long, slow line again to have my photo taken for a BJ's card.

if you give this as a gift, you will have to go to BJ's first to activate the membership. They ask you for recipient's name and address.

The groupon was the only thing that made the club worth it. I belong to Sam's and Costco, and this club just doesn't compete in their world, at least not in Richmond, VA. Their membership cost as much as the others, but don't join unless it's the only club available, or you have a super deal. They do carry items the other clubs don't, so I will shop there on occasion, but the store is basically the bottom line of discount clubs.

Does not compare to the staff, cleanliness, products that are offered by Costco where I am also a member. I only use BJ's because it is closer to my home than Costco. I only buy things like bread, water, butter, cheese & some frozen brand name items. It was a good deal for the convenience of getting these items in a pinch. Maybe other locations are better, but I am usually desperate in order to make a trip there.

Still doing my research, but Costco seems cheaper on some items. Of course BJ's does carry some items not at Costco, but nothing that ""wow'ed"" me. The staff are super friendly. In the end, and what it comes down to, I won't renew my membership simply because I'd rather not give my money to Wal-Mart. I don't shop at Wal-Mart now (and will go out of my way if possible) due to, among other thing, their labor practices.

Best to go in the mornings to avoid the crowds. Great place to fulfill your household needs at competitive prices. Meats and produce holds up well even against the best local purveyors. Despite the busy crowds, staff is generally helpful and knowledgable.

When my membership ran out a couple of years ago I really missed going. Great deals on so many things. I dont do ""weekly"" shopping there, but there are certain things I like getting in bulk. Cat litter, soaps, water.... What I really like is the coldcut department. GREAT items, very affordable, just wish they had more people working that counter! Doesnt matter, worth the wait.

BJ's is not as good as Costco or Sams club. However with this deal I felt it was a good buy. I did find things that I normally do not find in other stores. I have a year to shop and I am looking forward to going to BJ's this year.

Been meaning to get a membership to BJs for awhile. They offer bulk packs of merchandise, grocery & deli items, and most club locations have tires and basic automobile needs. Pricing is usually worth it over buying single items in the store, assuming you have a place to keep the extra until you need it.

I love BJ's Wholesale club. The employees are super friendly, it's very clean, they always have everything I need, and most of all you don't have to overbuy so much of the product and the prices are great and within the budget. I can actually see where I spendy money and not say I spent $100 dollars and only got 2 bags! I really love BJ's and I will for sure renew.

BJ's provides a more pleasant shopping experience than other clubs or large stores. I don't go for the prices, actually, since clubs (lately) are about as expensive as supermarkets and other retailers. Sometimes, however, you find things at Bj's that you won't find elsewhere.
