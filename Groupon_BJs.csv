Helen,Went to bj's to redeem coupon. They could not figure out how to enroll me as my email was apparently missing a member number. In an attempt to sort it out they decided they needed to hit the redeem button. It didn't work and no one in store couldn't sort it out.they said to just come back. Couldn't reach anyone at bj's customer service and no support through coupon.,3,2,0,1,"April 10, 2018",03/27/2021 21:33:52

Debbie,Really like the items at BJ's. I also have a Costco membership. They both have very different offerings from one another. I like BJs deli counter and bakery. The cons when comparing them to Costco- not as clean and bright. The BJs employees don't seem to have the enthusiasm that the Costco employees do. BJs is more like a warehouse atmosphere. I think the electronics and home goods are much more upscale at Costco.,13,9,1,0,"August 10, 2016",03/27/2021 21:46:50

Noemi,"I love BJ's Wholesale club. The employees are super friendly, it's very clean, they always have everything I need, and most of all you don't have to overbuy so much of the product and the prices are great and within the budget. I can actually see where I spendy money and not say I spent $100 dollars and only got 2 bags! I really love BJ's and I will for sure renew.",13,9,1,0,"February 15, 2018",03/27/2021 21:58:11

Donna,"BJ's provides a more pleasant shopping experience than other clubs or large stores. I don't go for the prices, actually, since clubs (lately) are about as expensive as supermarkets and other retailers. Sometimes, however, you find things at Bj's that you won't find elsewhere.",2,2,0,0,"February 15, 2018",03/27/2021 21:58:11
